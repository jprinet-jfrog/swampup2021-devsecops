# Lab 2

## Context

- Security team is running a security audit
- You want to swiftly confirm that everything is fine security wise

## Objective

- Configure JFrog Xray
- [Try to] Download the Docker image created during Lab 1

## Source properties

```bash
source scripts/build.env
```

## Init Lab properties

```bash
PROJECT_VERSION='0.0.9'

DOCKER_REPO_PROD=devsecops-docker-prod

DOCKER_REGISTRY_PROD="${ARTIFACTORY_HOSTNAME}/${DOCKER_REPO_PROD}"

IMAGE_NAME='swampup/devsecops'
IMAGE_ABSOLUTE_NAME_PROD="${DOCKER_REGISTRY_PROD}/${IMAGE_NAME}:${PROJECT_VERSION}"
```

## Check database synchronization is achieved

## Index resources

- Index **devsecops-docker-prod-local** repository 
- Expedite the indexing progress using the Index Now feature.

## Create Xray policy

Create **block-download-on-high-severity** security policy:
- trigger a violation on **high severity** security issue discovered
- **Block Download** and **Block Unscanned** Artifacts as actions

## Create Xray watch

Create **devsecops-docker-repo-watch** watch:
- add **devsecops-docker-prod-local** repository as resource
- add **block-download-on-high-severity** as policy

## Apply on existing content

## Download image

Remove local image:
```bash
docker rmi "${IMAGE_ABSOLUTE_NAME_PROD}" 2>/dev/null
```

Try to pull image from Artifactory:
```bash
docker pull "${IMAGE_ABSOLUTE_NAME_PROD}"
```

## Conclusion

Image is blocked by Xray policy.
